Benchmarking CSPong
=========

This project forks from CSSamples, a repository that has a CSPong game that aides the user in understanding how ChilliSource works. 

This serves only as a way to stress some of the ChilliSource systems, Particle and UI, in order to benchmark and fix bottlenecks  in them.
