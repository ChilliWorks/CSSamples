         Chilli Source Tour: UI
         ==============================
         
         UI in Chilli Source can be created in code or from .csui files.
         
         UI is described hierarchically with the canvas at the root. Changing properties on the parent will usually effect the children i.e. disabling user interaction on the root
         will make all children non-interactable. This is a good way of creating encapsulated widgets i.e. dialogue boxes, etc.
         
         UI uses a mixture of absolute and relative co-ordinates.
         Absolute co-ords are always in screen-space (i.e. pixels) with (0, 0) at the bottom left. Setting Absolute Size to 100x200 will always give an view at
         100x200 regardless of screen resolution or orientation. This is useful for views such as virtual thumbsticks which will have been tailored to the avergae size of a human thumb.
         Relative co-ords are specified as a percentage relative to the parent view size (again from the bottom left). Setting Relative Position to 0.5x0.5 will place the view at
         the centre of its parent. Setting the Relative Size = 1.0x1.0 will make the view the same size as its parent. Relative co-ords are useful for UI that needs to adapt based on
         the screen resolution.
         
         Relative size and positioning on its own is not enough to build scaleable UI you need to use anchors and consider the aspect ratio of any images. CS UI has 2 anchor properties
         
         The local anchor "OriginAnchor" which controls where the origin of the view is i.e. where it is rendered from and the "ParentalAnchor" which controls how it anchors to its parent.
         
         LocalAlignment = MiddleCentre
         ParentalAlignment = MiddleCentre
         
         |           |
         |    | |    |
         |           |
         
         LocalAlignment = TopLeft
         ParentalAlignment = TopLeft
         
         || |        |
         |           |
         |           |
         
         
         Widgets can also have a size policy. This governs how the widget will respond when the aspect ratio of its prefered size (in most cases the size of its image) is different to its
         actual size. The most common of these are "UseWidthMaintainingAspect", which will alter the widgets height to maintain aspect ratio with the given width, or "UseHeightMaintainingAspect"
         which will alter the widgets width to maintain aspect ratio with the given height.

         Chilli Source Tour: Events
         ==============================
         
         Chilli Source has various ways to register as a listener for an action. The simplest is simply setting a callback delegate using std::function which provides a one to one mapping. One of the most common
         methods is by using "events". Events allow multiple listeners to register against the same action. Listeners open a scoped connection to the event and while the connection renamins open will
         be notifed when the event occurs. Connections can be closed by either end (usually when they go out of scope).
         
         Buttons use events to inform listeners when they have been activated. The delegate that are passed to events can be std::functions or in this case an anonymous lambda function:
